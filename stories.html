				I made the trip back to Kamloops this week to see friends and 
				get some shooting done. We were able to catch a few hours of sun 
				in between all of the rain, and so I met up with Dylan Sherrard 
				and Brad Stuart to do a bit of shooting at the bike park.

			"Allan McVicar was the first to invite me to collaborate in his 
			efforts to expose the beauty of our riding and our landscape.
			Something about being involved in such artistic creations as 
			Allan's photos sparked a creative mission for me that has lasted 
			for years and will not soon burn out." &nbsp; &#8212; Dylan Sherrard (Silvia Films)

				I received Picture of the Month for April on 
				
				<a href="http://www.pinkbike.com/">Pinkbike</a>
				with a 
				photo I shot of Dylan last April. We shot some of the upper 
				bike park as the sun was setting and moved down after it set. 
				We set up pretty quickly on this jump and shot it a few times
				 before it got too dark. It was the only time I got to shoot 
				 Mountain Biking in the past year, and the only time I have 
				 shot with Dylan in the last two years probably. This photo 
				 got us talking again about shooting plans and I can't wait 
				 for the summer to get started!
